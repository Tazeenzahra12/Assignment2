Task Description:

I have created;

1- class car with attributes
2- constructor of class car
3- method getcarinfo to get the output of all attributes
4- Class carlist to ensure the security and reuseability.
5- In the main class, I have made three methods to filter the list accordingly. bybrand,bymodelandyear,byyearandprice.
6- in each class I have used filewriter in order to make file and I used Writer to save the file. I have also used IO Exceptions because its necessary when we are dealing with IO file operation such as reading and saving. I have made string and that string is basically saving to file and to the output console.
then I have called the methods by passing values to it.
